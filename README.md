# Hackathon 2023 - Buffalo Museum of Science

To help improve the museum with keeping accurate quantitative footfall data, we have devised a solution that incorporates interactive technology for both vistors and museum coordinators.

Our solution is to add RFID readers along the entrances and exits of the museum and the exhibits within the museum. Visitors will be given wristbands with RFID tags that they will wear during their visit, and return to the museum upon exit. Entry and exit data will be recorded, from which an easily viewable live heatmap will be constructed. This heatmap visually displays how populated each exhibit is based on the footfall data that is being collected.

The file heatmap.py demonstrates a live user interface that museum coordinators can see as people enter and exit the museum and rooms within the museum. This demo represents 200 random visitors visiting the museum within a 2-hour period. The map will get darker as more people enter a room, and keeps a live count of how many people are in the museum at all times. This will give the museum a live and accurate tally of how many people visit each exhibit, and how long they spend in each room.

On top of this, we have designed a mobile application which provides visitors with additional immersion into the museum experience. An interactive version of the application can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/ZeYgNc5F9iuTIJSORSIikO/Hackathon?type=design&node-id=1-20&t=aF5WzdYejk8M082x-0&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=6%3A2).
